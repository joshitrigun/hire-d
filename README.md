## Setup

Install dependencies by going into each folder, react-front-end and express-back-end, and in each folder running `npm install`. Once dependencies are installed open 2 terminals and run `npm start` in each folder. These steps are only necessary if you want to download the repo locally in which case you need to select the local-version branch before download/cloning.
